# RTL Design Practice using Verilog HDL

This repository contains **chapter-wise RTL design implementations and practice codes**
developed while studying and understanding concepts from the book  
**"FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples" by Pong P. Chu**.

The primary objective of this repository is **learning and practicing Verilog HDL**
for digital design, FPGA-based labs, and VLSI-oriented applications.

---

## Purpose of This Repository
- Strengthen **digital design fundamentals**
- Practice **synthesizable Verilog HDL**
- Understand RTL coding style used in **FPGA and ASIC design**
- Prepare for **RTL and VLSI core interviews**

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized in a **chapter-wise manner** corresponding to the concepts
covered in the reference book and laboratory exercises.


Each chapter folder may contain:
- Verilog source files (`.v`)
- Supporting modules
- Testbenches
- FPGA-oriented lab implementations

---

## Reference Material
- **Book:** *FPGA Prototyping by Verilog Examples*
- **Author:** Pong P. Chu
- **Usage:** Educational and academic learning reference

---

## Tools Used
- **Xilinx Vivado** (FPGA lab implementation & simulation)
- Verilog HDL

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved understanding of **RTL design principles**
- Hands-on experience with **FPGA-based Verilog development**
- Familiarity with **simulation, synthesis, and basic implementation flow**
- Better preparedness for **RTL / VLSI interviews and labs**

---

## Note
Folder names will be **gradually refactored** into meaningful module-based directories
(e.g., adders, multiplexers, counters, FSMs) as part of continuous improvement and
professional repository organisation.

## Disclaimer
This repository is maintained **strictly for educational purposes**.  
The content represents personal learning and practice derived from the reference material
and academic laboratory work.
